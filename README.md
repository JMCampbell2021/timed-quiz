# NBA Timed-Quiz

## Discription
For this assignment/challenge I was asked to create an application that is a timed quiz. I took a different approach to what was asked when it came down to the topic and questions. Instead of the same old JavaScript fundamentals question I wanted to go with a fun sports timed quiz. In this application I used the knowledge I learned through out the boot camp of JavaScritpt, HTML and CSS. I believe I still met some of the acceptence criteria.
